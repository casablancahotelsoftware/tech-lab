### Task Description: Workshop on "AI-Assisted Code Search & Explanation Tool"

#### Objective:
The goal of this workshop is to design and build a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** application that serves as an AI-assisted tool for code search, explanation, or Issues resolution. Participants will learn to create a system that enables students or developers to search for code snippets, receive detailed explanations and leveraging the power of AI-driven contextual understanding. The workshop will focus on demonstrating advanced features like contextual search beyond basic keyword matching, prompt-engineering techniques, and the integration of AI models for code explanation and issue resolution.

#### Key Deliverables:
By the end of the workshop, participants will have developed a functional prototype of the following system:

1. **Code Search Module**:
   - Use of a retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant code snippets from a pre-defined dataset or repository.
   - Demonstrate **contextual search capabilities** that go beyond keyword-based retrieval, understanding the intent of the query.

2. **Code Explanation Module**:
   - An AI model (e.g., API like Azure OpenAI GPT) that provides detailed explanations of the retrieved code snippets.
   - Explanations should include:
     - Purpose of the code.
     - Description of the logic and key components.
     - Potential use cases or limitations.

3. **Code Issue Resolution Module**:
   - A feature that allows users to submit code snippets with issues (e.g., bugs or inefficiencies).
   - The system should analyze the code and suggest improvements or refactoring options.
   - Provide explanations for the suggested changes, enhancing the user's understanding of best practices.

#### Learning Outcomes:
Participants will:
- Understand the principles of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and how it enhances contextual search capabilities.
- Learn to integrate AI models (e.g., GPT) into applications for natural language understanding and generation.
- Gain experience in setting up a retrieval pipeline with tools like **Qdrant**, **Semantic-Kernel**, or **LangChain**.
- Explore techniques for **prompt engineering** to improve the quality of AI-generated explanations.
