# Preparing Documents for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique where a language model’s responses are augmented with information retrieved from an external knowledge base. Instead of relying solely on the model’s internal knowledge, RAG systems search a document collection for relevant text **chunks** and supply those chunks as context for the model’s generation. A crucial preprocessing step in building a RAG application is **document chunking** – dividing raw documents into smaller, self-contained pieces of text. The quality and structure of these chunks directly influence retrieval relevance and the accuracy of the model’s outputs](https://apxml.com/posts/rag-chunking-strategies-explained). Large Language Models (LLMs) and embedding models have finite context windows, so long documents must be split into segments that fit within those limits. By chunking documents, a RAG system can quickly search through relevant segments rather than scanning entire files, improving both speed and answer quality.

**Why Chunk Documents?** Breaking source text into well-defined chunks offers several benefits:

- **Improved Retrieval Efficiency:** Smaller chunks allow the retriever to quickly pinpoint relevant information without scanning irrelevant text, leading to faster query responses. This makes real-time Q&A more feasible even with large documents.
  
- **Handling Context Limits:** LLMs have maximum token limits, and embeddings models also cap input length. Chunking ensures each piece of text stays within these bounds so the model can process it without truncation. This avoids losing important content that would be cut off if a whole document were fed into the model.
  
- **Enhanced Accuracy and Relevance:** Segmenting documents into focused chunks helps retrieve the most pertinent piece for a query. The system can rank smaller, topic-specific chunks by relevance more easily than giant blocks of text. Chunks that are semantically coherent yield more precise and contextually correct answers from the LLM.
  
- **Optimized Memory Usage:** By retrieving only a few relevant chunks at query time rather than loading entire documents, the RAG pipeline uses memory more efficiently. This is especially important when deploying on hardware with limited RAM or when scaling to large document sets.

In summary, effective chunking of source documents is foundational for RAG. Below, we provide a step-by-step guide to preprocess raw documents into chunks suitable for a simple coding RAG application, along with best practices and illustrative examples.

## Step-by-Step Document Preprocessing for RAG

1. **Clean and Normalize Raw Text:** Begin by gathering the source documents and converting them into plain text. Remove any irrelevant or noisy content that could interfere with chunking or retrieval. This includes eliminating HTML/XML tags, scripts, navigation menus, and other boilerplate if you scraped web pages. Strip out excessive whitespace, non-printable characters, or artifacts like duplicate headers and footers. Ensure the text is consistently encoded (e.g. UTF-8) and formatted. You may also apply basic normalization such as lowercasing the text (if case does not carry meaning) and standardizing punctuation or spacing. The goal is to produce a clean text corpus where each document’s content is clear and ready for splitting. For example, if you crawled HTML documentation, first use an HTML parser to extract visible text and remove tags, then fix any encoding issues or irregular characters in the output.

2. **Choose a Chunking Strategy and Size:** Decide how to break each document into chunks. The optimal strategy can depend on the structure and content of your documents:

   - **Fixed-Size Chunks:** Split text into equal-sized blocks (e.g. based on a set number of characters, words, or tokens). This method is simple and easy to implement](https://apxml.com/posts/rag-chunking-strategies-explained). For instance, you might cut every 500 words into a chunk. However, fixed-length splitting can slice through sentences or ideas arbitrarily, potentially disrupting the meaning](https://apxml.com/posts/rag-chunking-strategies-explained). It’s recommended to include an overlap between consecutive chunks to avoid losing context that falls on a boundary. For example, using a 200-word chunk size with a 20-word overlap means each new chunk shares some text with the previous chunk, helping maintain continuity of thought. Fixed-size chunking works best for uniformly structured text, but be aware that it may break semantic units (see the example below).

   - **Structure-Based Chunks:** Leverage the document’s natural structure (paragraphs, sections, sentences, or markup) to guide splitting. In this approach, you split at logical boundaries – for example, each paragraph or subsection becomes its own chunk, possibly merging small paragraphs together if they are closely related. A recursive splitting technique can be used: first split by larger separators (like chapter or section titles, if present), then by paragraph breaks (`\n\n`), then by sentence breaks, until chunks are below the desired size. This preserves whole sentences and topics, avoiding chopping a thought in half. Many frameworks implement this strategy. For instance, LangChain’s `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` uses a hierarchy of separators (by default, double newlines, then single newlines, then spaces) to split text while respecting sentence and paragraph boundaries. Structure-based chunking ensures each chunk remains semantically coherent and is especially useful for documents with headings, lists, or other formatting.

   - **Semantic Chunks:** For a more advanced approach, consider semantic or topic-based chunking. This involves analyzing the text (often via embeddings or clustering algorithms) to group sentences or paragraphs that relate to the same concept, instead of splitting purely by length. Tools like LlamaIndex offer semantic text splitters that combine sentences into a chunk if they are closely related in meaning. The result is that each chunk represents a distinct topic or subtopic. Semantic chunking can yield highly relevant retrieval units (since each chunk is topically pure), but it requires additional computation (to compute embeddings or similarity scores during preprocessing) and can be complex to implement. It’s beneficial when documents are very large or cover diverse topics, as it avoids mixing unrelated content in one chunk.

   - **Domain-Specific Chunks:** Tailor your chunking method to the content type if needed. For example, if your documents contain source code or technical data, you might split by logical code blocks or sections. Instead of breaking code files arbitrarily, you would split before function or class definitions, so each chunk contains a complete function or logical unit of code. This ensures that each chunk of code is syntactically correct and meaningful on its own. As another example, if your data is in HTML/Markdown with sections and lists, you might use those tags or headers as split points to preserve the structure of the information. Domain-specific chunking often requires custom separators or rules (e.g., splitting on keywords like “def ” or “class ” in Python code), but it greatly improves coherence for structured documents. 

   Along with strategy, choose an appropriate **chunk size** (the target length of each chunk). This is typically measured in tokens or characters. Chunks need to be small enough to fit in the embedding model and LLM’s context window, but large enough to contain a complete thought. In practice, optimal chunk sizes often range from about **128 to 512 tokens** (roughly a few hundred words). Smaller chunks (e.g. 128–256 tokens) provide very fine-grained pieces useful for pinpoint fact-finding, whereas larger chunks (256–512 tokens) carry more context which can help answer more complex or open-ended questions. As a starting point, many developers use a chunk size around *200–300 words* (approximately 250 tokens, or ~1000 characters). This tends to capture a paragraph or two of text, which is often a semantically self-contained unit. You may adjust this based on your use case – for example, a Q&A bot might favor smaller, precise chunks, while a summarization task may benefit from larger chunks that encompass more of the document’s context. It’s wise to experiment with a few sizes to find a balance between context and relevance, and always ensure no chunk exceeds the hard limit of your models’ context length.

3. **Split the Text into Chunks:** Now apply the chosen strategy to actually break each document’s text into chunks. It’s important to implement this carefully to avoid errors like losing text or misaligning chunks. If you use an existing library or framework, many of these details are handled for you. For example, using LangChain in Python, you can do something like: 

   ```python
   from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter

   document_text = open("example_doc.txt").read()
   splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(
       separator="\n\n",      # split on double newline (paragraph) first
       chunk_size=1000,       # max 1000 characters per chunk
       chunk_overlap=200      # 200 chars overlap to maintain context
   )
   chunks = splitter.split_text(document_text)
   print(f"{len(chunks)} chunks created.")
   ``` 

   In this snippet, we split a document by paragraphs while allowing up to 1000 characters per chunk and 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The output `chunks` would be a list of text segments. Under the hood, the splitter first tries to break on `"\n\n"` (paragraph boundaries); if a paragraph is longer than 1000 characters, it will then split at smaller breakpoints (like single newlines or spaces) to respect the size limit. This ensures we don’t cut a sentence in half unless absolutely necessary. If not using a library, you can implement splitting logic yourself. A simple approach is to tokenize the text (by words or characters) and slice the tokens into chunks of the desired length, adding overlap as needed. For example, a basic word-splitting function might take 200-word increments from a list of words. However, naive splitting by fixed length has pitfalls: it may break sentences improperly and drop punctuation. A better custom implementation would find the nearest sentence boundary before the length limit – for instance, accumulate sentences until adding one more would exceed 250 tokens, then start a new chunk. Using NLP libraries like **spaCy** or **NLTK** to split text into sentences can help maintain coherence. You could split paragraphs into sentences and then group sentences into chunks up to a token limit.

   Here you can find the [LangChain documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/text_splitters/). 

   **Maintaining Context Across Chunks:** If you are using fixed-size chunks, include overlapping content between chunks to provide context continuity. Typically an overlap of about 10–20% of the chunk size works well. For instance, if chunks are ~200 tokens, having the last 20 tokens of one chunk repeated at the start of the next chunk helps to avoid losing the thread of a discussion that straddles the boundary. This way, when a query hits something that was cut off at the end of a chunk, the overlapping portion in the next chunk can still allow the model to see the relevant text. Be mindful not to choose an overlap that is too large, as it increases redundancy and storage without much added benefit – just enough to cover an incomplete sentence or to remind the model of the previous context is ideal. If using a content-aware splitter (paragraph/sentence based), heavy overlap may not be needed, since you aren’t breaking in the middle of sentences. Even so, some slight overlap or repeating of a header can sometimes be useful if the logical sections are small or if you want to reinforce context. 

   > *Example:* Suppose we have the sentence: "Artificial intelligence is rapidly changing our daily routines. Machine learning, a subset of AI, involves algorithms that learn from data." A naive fixed-size splitter set to, say, 70 characters might cut this into chunks like "...daily routines. Machine " and then "learning, a subset of AI, involves..." which splits the phrase “Machine learning” apart](https://apxml.com/posts/rag-chunking-strategies-explained). By using smarter rules (splitting at the period or at whitespace boundaries) or adding overlapping text, we can ensure one chunk ends with "...daily routines." and the next begins with "Machine learning, a subset of AI,...", preserving the integrity of that concept. This underscores why respecting natural language boundaries during chunking is important for downstream accuracy.

4. **Annotate Chunks with Metadata:** As you create chunks, record metadata for each chunk that will be helpful during retrieval and generation. Common metadata includes the source document title or ID, section headings, page number (for PDFs), or even the position of the chunk within the document (e.g., chunk index). By tagging each chunk with its origin and context, the RAG system can later use this information to filter or prioritize results and to produce citations or references in answers. For example, you might store a `source` field ("KnowledgeBase_Article_42") and a `section` field ("Conclusion") with every chunk. If working with code, you might add metadata like `language: "python"` or `function_name: <name>` for chunks that correspond to a particular function. Metadata can be stored alongside the chunk text when indexing (most vector databases allow storing metadata with each vector). It’s also good practice to assign each chunk a unique identifier. This could simply be a composite of the document ID and an index number, or a hash of the chunk text. Unique IDs ensure you can trace a chunk back to its exact position in the source and also help avoid inserting duplicate chunks. In fact, if your corpus has a lot of repetitive text (e.g., the same disclaimer or navigation menu on every page), you may want to **deduplicate chunks** at this stage – for instance, by hashing each chunk’s content and skipping any new chunk whose hash you’ve seen before. Removing redundant chunks keeps your index cleaner and smaller, which can improve retrieval speed and reduce confusion for the model (since you won’t retrieve the same sentence from multiple sources).

5. **Embed Chunks and Build the Index:** Once you have a set of clean, well-defined chunks with metadata, the next step (moving beyond preprocessing into indexing) is to convert each chunk into a numeric vector representation. Using a pre-trained text embedding model, generate an embedding for each chunk. For example, you might use OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002 or Cohere’s embedding model to produce a vector for the chunk’s text. (Ensure the chunk length is within the embedding model’s token limit—this was one reason we sized our chunks appropriately.) After embedding, store these vectors in a **vector database** or index, such as Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, or FAISS. Each vector entry should retain the chunk’s metadata and perhaps the original text or an ID pointer to it. Storing embeddings in a vector index allows efficient similarity search: given a new query, you will embed the query in the same vector space and find the stored chunk vectors that are closest to the query vector (e.g., via cosine similarity). Those top-matching chunks are then retrieved as relevant context. In a RAG application pipeline, you would finally take the retrieved chunk texts and insert them (along with their source info if needed) into the LLM’s prompt to help answer the user’s question. At this stage, your raw documents have been fully transformed into an easy-to-search knowledge base: a collection of vectorized chunks. The RAG system is ready to use – when a query comes in, it will look up the nearest chunk vectors and feed those chunks into the generation step, enabling the LLM to produce answers grounded in your documents.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Maintain Semantic Coherence:** Always try to split documents in a way that each chunk represents a complete thought or section. Avoid breaking sentences in half or splitting a paragraph such that the meaning is lost. Chunks that preserve context on their own will be far more useful and will match queries more accurately. Use natural delimiters (like paragraph breaks, sentence boundaries, or section headers) as cut points whenever possible.

- **Choose Balanced Chunk Sizes:** Extremely small chunks (just a sentence or two) might be too fragmented – the model could miss the broader context and retrieve irrelevant bits. Overly large chunks, on the other hand, may dilute important details with too much surrounding text and risk exceeding token limits. Aim for a middle ground (commonly a few hundred tokens per chunk) and adjust based on the application. For factual Q&A, err on the smaller side to increase precision; for explanatory or narrative tasks, slightly larger chunks can provide necessary context. Always ensure the total size of chunks you plan to feed into the LLM at once is well within its context window.

- **Use Overlap to Preserve Context:** When splitting by fixed lengths or when cutting around a boundary, include a bit of overlapping text between chunks so that context isn’t abruptly lost. For example, duplicating the last sentence of one chunk at the start of the next can help maintain continuity. This is particularly useful if an important point is made at a chunk boundary. Keep overlaps relatively small (perhaps 10–20% of the chunk size) to avoid too much repetition.

- **Leverage Structure and Formatting:** Take advantage of the document’s format. If the text is structured (HTML, Markdown, PDF with headings), use that hierarchy to guide chunking rather than treating it as one long string. This might involve using a parser to detect titles, list items, or code blocks. A layout-aware or “document-based” chunking approach that aligns chunks with existing sections leads to more meaningful segments. For code documents, use language-specific cues (split before function definitions, etc.) so that chunks don’t contain orphaned code fragments.

- **Attach Metadata for Traceability:** Keep track of origin data for each chunk. This includes at least a document identifier and possibly section labels or timestamps. Metadata can be used at query time to filter results (e.g., only retrieve chunks from a certain manual) and is invaluable for providing citations or references in the generated answer. It can also help avoid returning multiple chunks that say the same thing – if you know two chunks come from the same source or are consecutive, you might choose only one of them for the final prompt, to reduce redundancy.

- **Filter Out Noise and Duplicates:** Not all text in your documents is worth indexing. Before chunking, or even after chunking, consider removing content that is not useful for answering questions. Examples include navigation links, unrelated sidebars, or repeated legal disclaimers on every page. These can be excluded during preprocessing so they never become chunks. Also, if the same exact sentence or paragraph appears in many documents, decide if you want to store it multiple times. Often you can save space and confusion by storing one representative chunk and referencing it, rather than indexing duplicate text from every occurrence.

- **Iterate and Evaluate:** The “right” chunking strategy and size may vary – there is no one-size-fits-all. It is helpful to experiment with your own data. Try creating chunks with different sizes (e.g., 150 tokens vs 300 tokens) and test the RAG system’s outputs. Evaluate whether the retrieved chunks are actually useful and on-topic for sample queries. If you find the model is missing context, you might need slightly larger chunks. If it’s retrieving a lot of irrelevant text, smaller, more specific chunks could help. Monitoring the system’s performance and tweaking chunking parameters is a normal part of developing a RAG application. Over time, you’ll converge on a configuration that offers a good trade-off for your particular dataset and application needs.

By following these guidelines – cleaning your data, chunking it thoughtfully, and indexing it with relevant metadata – you set a strong foundation for a retrieval-augmented generation system. Good chunking ensures that when your application is asked a question, it can rapidly fetch the right pieces of knowledge and feed them to the language model, resulting in accurate and context-rich answers grounded in your documents.
